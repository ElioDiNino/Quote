> Quote allows you to quote messages in a better way

## Usage
### `> <text>`
Find a message that contains `text` from the same channel, and replace your message to an embed.

### `<url>`
Find a message from the URL and replace your message with an embed.

## How it works
Quote uses Discord's Webhook API to send messages to customize the username and the avatar. We delete the original message and use this technique to pretend the message as if it was sent by another user.

## FAQ
### Quote didn't find the message despite I used the command properly
Due to Discord's API limitation, the number of messages you can go back is restricted up to 100. Alternatively, we provide another way that uses URL to quote so you can use it to avoid the issue.

### Why my message has a badge *BOT*?
Since Quote uses Discord's Webhook API to replace your message, the embed was actually sent by the bot though it is pretended as if you sent it.

### This is an awesome idea! Why don't Discord implement it officially?
I don't know ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Tell them to hire me.
